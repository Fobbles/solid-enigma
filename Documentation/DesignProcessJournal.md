We made a physical example of the ramp in real life. basically the ramp is going to need to move by two doodads that hold it up.
These doodads will be the ones moving it up and down (Or i think they should be nestled in pockets inside the platform itself)
First step: make a singular doodad that can go up and down. 
What button will be used to move it?
It's being made on a mouse and keyboard, so we innitially need keyboard controals anyway before even considering controllers.
